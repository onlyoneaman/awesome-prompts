  {
    question: "What is a Prompt Engineer?",
    answer: "A Prompt Engineer is someone who specializes in designing, testing, and optimizing prompts for AI systems. They understand how to craft effective prompts that produce desired outputs from AI models. Prompt engineers experiment with different phrasings, structures, and techniques to achieve better results, understand model limitations, and create reusable prompt templates for various use cases."
  },
  {
    question: "What are difficulties?",
    answer: "Difficulties indicate the complexity level of using a prompt effectively. We categorize prompts into three levels: Beginner (easy to use, straightforward), Intermediate (requires some understanding of the AI tool and prompt structure), and Advanced (complex prompts that may require technical knowledge or multiple steps). Choose prompts that match your experience level to get the best results."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I use these prompts?",
    answer: "Simply browse our collection, find a prompt that fits your needs, and copy it. You can then paste it into your preferred AI tool (ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, etc.). Many prompts include placeholders (marked with [BRACKETS]) that you should replace with your specific information. Read the prompt description for any special instructions or requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "Are these prompts free to use?",
    answer: "Yes! All prompts on Promptsmint are completely free to use. This is an open-source project, and we encourage you to use, modify, and share these prompts for any purpose. We believe in making AI more accessible to everyone."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I contribute my own prompts?",
    answer: "Absolutely! We welcome contributions from the community. You can submit prompts through our Submit Prompt page. Make sure your prompts are well-tested, clearly written, and include proper descriptions and categories. Check our Contributing guidelines for more details on how to contribute."
  },
  {
    question: "What types of prompts are available?",
    answer: "We have prompts across 17 categories including Business, Psychology, Images, Portraits, Videos, Writing, Strategy, Productivity, Marketing, Programming, Creativity, Illustration, Designer, Graphics, Product UI/UX, SEO, and Learning. Each category contains prompts tailored to specific use cases and industries."
  },
  {
    question: "Do prompts work with all AI models?",
    answer: "Most prompts are designed to work with multiple AI models, but results may vary. Text prompts generally work well across ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, and similar models. Image and video prompts are typically model-specific. Check the prompt description for recommended AI tools or any model-specific requirements."
  },
  {
    question: "What does 'reference image' mean?",
    answer: "Some prompts require a reference image to work effectively. This means you need to provide an image along with the prompt text. The AI will use your reference image to generate outputs that match the style, composition, or subject matter. Prompts that require reference images are clearly marked with a 'Reference' badge."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I search for prompts?",
    answer: "You can search prompts by title, description, or tags using our search bar. You can also browse by category, filter by difficulty level, or sort by date, difficulty, or alphabetically. Use the search and filter options to quickly find exactly what you need."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I request custom prompts?",
    answer: "Yes! If you can't find what you're looking for, you can request custom prompts through our Request Prompt page. We'll work with you to create prompts tailored to your specific needs, whether for business, creative projects, or personal use."
  },
  {
    question: "How often are new prompts added?",
    answer: "We regularly add new prompts to our collection. The community also contributes prompts, so our library is constantly growing. Check our Changelog page to see recent additions and updates. You can also follow us on social media for announcements about new prompts."
  },
  {
    question: "What's the difference between text, image, and video prompts?",
    answer: "Text prompts generate written content, code, or text-based responses. Image prompts are used with image generation AI tools (like DALL-E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) to create images. Video prompts are for AI video generation tools. Each type is clearly labeled, and you can filter by prompt type to find what you need."
  },
  {
    question: "How do I know if a prompt is good quality?",
    answer: "All prompts in our collection are curated and tested. We include difficulty ratings, clear descriptions, and examples where applicable. Prompts with higher engagement (views, likes) are often more popular and well-tested. Featured prompts are highlighted as particularly high-quality examples."
  },
  {
    question: "Can I modify these prompts?",
    answer: "Yes! Feel free to modify any prompt to suit your specific needs. Prompts are starting points - you can adjust wording, add context, change parameters, or combine elements from multiple prompts. Experimentation is encouraged to get the best results for your use case."
