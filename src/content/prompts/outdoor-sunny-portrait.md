  "prompt": "A sunny outdoor lifestyle portrait of a woman sitting gracefully on white stone stairs, wearing a delicate floral bikini. She sits with her legs crossed and arms resting naturally, her wavy dark hair falling loosely over her shoulder. Soft dappled shadows from nearby foliage fall across her body and face, adding texture and depth. Her expression is calm and relaxed, embodying a summery aesthetic. The setting features clean white stucco walls framing the staircase, creating strong geometric lines and balance. Vibrant flowers cascade adding a bold pop of color against the neutral backdrop. A glimpse of clear blue sky in the upper portion enhances the bright, serene mood. A subtle, ethereal glow emanates from the bougainvillea, casting faint, warm reflections on the stairs, suggesting a magical, summery aura.",
