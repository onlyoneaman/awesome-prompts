Prompt: Attractive young woman taking a selfie in her bedroom, portrait orientation, upper-body framing. She has clear blue eyes, pale porcelain skin, and long, straight jet-black hair falling naturally over her shoulders. Her beauty feels effortless and calm. She wears a white tank top with a deep neckline, tasteful and casual. Her expression is neutral, relaxed—unaware, slightly distant.

Direct smartphone flash photography illuminates her face and torso sharply, producing realistic skin texture, soft shine, and crisp eye catchlights. The flash creates a stark separation between her and the room behind her.

The bedroom is wide and spacious, decorated in a cute, comforting style: plush dolls arranged on shelves, a cozy bed with Pokémon-themed sheets, soft pastel colors, gentle shapes. The environment feels innocent, warm, and safe—almost childlike.

Far behind her, approximately 10 meters away, a window is visible. Outside the window, barely detectable in the darkness, the vague silhouette of a man's head can be seen. It is extremely subtle—partially obscured by reflections, shadow, and distance. The figure is not centered, not sharp, and easy to miss entirely. Its presence feels ambiguous: possibly imagined, possibly real.

The horror is psychological, not explicit. No dramatic expressions, no motion, no jumpscare. The unease comes from contrast—the bright, cheerful interior versus the quiet, distant anomaly. The viewer questions whether the figure is truly there.

Shallow depth of field keeps the woman as the dominant focus while the background softly dissolves into uncertainty.
Photorealistic, cinematic realism, restrained tension, uncanny atmosphere, slow-burn dread, modern smartphone selfie aesthetic, ultra-high detail.

Lighting

Harsh phone flash on subject, soft ambient bedroom lighting, faint cold moonlight outside the window.

Camera / Composition

Front-facing smartphone camera look, slight wide-angle distortion, eye-level angle, centered subject, distant background subtly readable but blurred.
