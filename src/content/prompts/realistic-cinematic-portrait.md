[CAMERA] : Close-up portrait, shot on a full-frame shot on Leica SL2-S, paired with a vintage 85mm f/1.4 lens (Leica Summilux). Aperture wide open to achieve shallow depth of field and background bokeh compression. ISO set low (100–200), shutter speed balanced for handhold with backlight compensation.

[SUBJECT] : Female figure with tousled short blonde hair, freckles, and soft, shadow-split facial structure. Hair partially obscures face, lips parted. Skin texture natural, no makeup stylization. Outfit: worn earth-toned wool blazer and loose-collared shirt, suggesting post-narrative realism or fashion desaturation.

[LIGHTING] : Natural golden hour backlight, hard directional sunlight rim-lighting hair and cheeks from rear-right. Natural shadow falloff, light flare slightly present on background. Likely assisted by minimal fill from bounce or reflector low front.

[SET] : Open desert with loose gravel or sand, distant structures in soft blur. Fine haze or dust in ambient air. Background low in frame, prioritizing sky and atmosphere.

[COLOR] : Warm-cool grade. Cyan shadows, amber highlights. Skin tones purposefully muted. Slight filmic grain or analog emulation applied.

[STYLE] : Neo-Western environmental portraiture. Visuals draw from narrative realism, contemporary fashion editorial, and fine-art desert portraiture. Influence akin to Gregory Crewdson’s minimal realism or Peter Lindbergh’s emotional grit.

[CREATIVE REF] : Gritty minimal portrait, wind in hair, golden hour flare, grounded emotion, isolation tension.

[CONTEXTUAL TOKENS] : female subject, desert portrait, golden hour light, dusty backlight, vintage lens compression, emotional atmosphere, cinematic texture, shallow DOF, wind-blown hair, natural freckles, textured blazer, muted color grade
