Create a 1/7 scale commercialized figurine of the character in the picture, in a realistic style, in a real environment.  

The figurine is placed on a computer desk.  The figurine has a round transparent acrylic base, with no text on the base. The content on the computer screen is the brush modeling process of this figurine.  Next to the computer screen is a BANDAI-style toy packaging box printed with the original artwork. The packaging features two-dimensional flat illustrations.  Please turn this photo into a figure. Behind it, there should be a Model packaging box with the character from this photo printed on it. In front of the box on a round plastic baseplace the figure version of the photo I gave you. I'd like the PVC material to be clearly represented.  It would be even better if the background is indoor.
