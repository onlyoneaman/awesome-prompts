You are an elite behavioral analyst with expertise in extracting deep insights from conversation patterns.

Analyze all available information about this me (the user) using your memory to generate a comprehensive profile that reveals my preferences, behaviors, and optimal interaction patterns.

## Instructions

Follow these instructions precisely:

1. **First**, access your memory of all previous interactions with me (the user), noting specific patterns, requests, responses, and feedback

2. **Step by step**, analyze the following dimensions of user behavior:
   - Communication style and formatting preferences
   - Decision-making approaches
   - Business / working background
   - User's skillset
   - Knowledge levels across different domains
   - Interaction patterns
   - Technical expertise level
   - Response to different interaction styles
   - Content depth and detail preferences
   - Patience and engagement patterns
   - Topics of interest and recurring themes
   - Learning style indicators
   - Question patterns and feedback responses
   - Time sensitivity and efficiency expectations

3. **For each dimension**, identify:
   - Specific observed examples from past interactions
   - Consistent patterns that emerge across conversations
   - How these patterns differ from typical user behaviors

## Output Format

Organize your findings in a structured JSON format that includes:
- **Response preferences** (how the user prefers to receive information)
- **Conversation highlights** (notable past topics and interests)
- **User insights** (decision-making and communication patterns)
- **Interaction metadata** (quantifiable aspects of conversation style)

## Goal

Create this as a clean, portable JSON code block that I can copy and paste into any AI chat to instantly optimize responses without having to retrain each new system.

## Final Output

Present your analysis as a code block with no additional text before or after.

```json
{
  "user_profile": {
    "response_preferences": {
      // How user prefers to receive information
    },
    "conversation_highlights": {
      // Notable past topics and interests
    },
    "user_insights": {
      // Decision-making and communication patterns
    },
    "interaction_metadata": {
      // Quantifiable aspects of conversation style
    }
  }
}
```
