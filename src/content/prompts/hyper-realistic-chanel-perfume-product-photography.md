title: "Hyper-Realistic Chanel Perfume Product Photography"
description: "A hyper-realistic product photograph of a premium round glass perfume bottle labeled 'CHANEL Chance', standing upright on a polished marble surface. Around the base, soft rose petals and scattered golden sparkles form an elegant, stylized layout. A diagonal pink flower branch with dewdrops adds warmth. Gentle perfume mist drifts in the air with shallow depth of field. The backdrop is soft champagne-gold with bokeh. Studio lighting highlights the glossy glass and metallic spray cap, casting crisp reflections."

A hyper-realistic product photograph of a premium round glass perfume bottle labeled "CHANEL Chance", standing upright on a polished marble surface. Around the base, soft rose petals and scattered golden sparkles form an elegant, stylized layout. A diagonal pink flower branch with dewdrops adds warmth. Gentle perfume mist drifts in the air with shallow depth of field for motion. The backdrop is soft champagne-gold with bokeh. Studio lighting highlights the glossy glass and metallic spray cap, casting crisp reflections. Shot in ultra high-res with a Sony Alpha A7 III, 50mm lens, cinematic studio lighting.
