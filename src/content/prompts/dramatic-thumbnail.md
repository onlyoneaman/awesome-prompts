Create Image

Ultra-realistic, high-resolution YouTube thumbnail of Robert Kiyosaki, author of 'Rich Dad Poor Dad,' looking furious and intense, lit with dramatic red lighting and shadows. Add strong cinematic glow and depth, with high contrast and sharp details. Surround him with chaotic visual effects — light streaks, sparks, shattered glass particles — to create tension. Background should be dark and gritty with hints of financial imagery (blurred dollar bills, charts) for context. The word 'LIAR' should be split: bold 'LI' in huge white text on the right side, bold 'AR' on the left side, both with a thick black stroke and red glow. Ensure facial expression is exaggerated for emotional impact, with textures and contrast that make it pop in a YouTube feed. Composition centered on face, text large and readable in small preview size, vibrant colors, 16:9 aspect ratio
